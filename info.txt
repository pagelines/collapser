== Description ==

Collapser is a simple but handy section that provides a way to show small pieces of information using an accordion-nav type with a feature image on a side to stand out the content.

Every accordion item is a independent post using the WordPress build in "custom post type" and every accordion item use a unique image that you can setup with a couple of clicks also in every accordion item you can configurate:

* Title
* Content
* Feature Image
* External link (Optional)
* Link text (Optional)

Customization? Sure,  8 color settings to play with, also Collapser is cloneable, that means that you can use any number of instances on a single page to show different information at the same time.

On any instance, you can chose a different: 

* Section title 
* Categories
* Number of post to show
* 8 different color per instance.
* Thumbnail position (Left or right)

And of course Collapser is full responsive.
